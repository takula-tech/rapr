# Code of Conduct

_Adapted from the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct), [Node.js Policy on Trolling](http://blog.izs.me/post/30036893703/policy-on-trolling), and [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org)._

## Our Commitment

We commit to creating an inclusive and harassment-free environment for all community members, regardless of their background, identity, or personal characteristics. Our goal is to foster a welcoming, diverse, and healthy community where everyone can participate freely.

## Community Guidelines

We believe in creating a positive environment where members support each other. Beyond technical excellence, we encourage:

* Respectful and professional communication
* Openness to different viewpoints and experiences
* Constructive feedback and discussions
* Focus on collaborative problem-solving

Unacceptable behaviors include:

* Harassment or discrimination of any kind
* Offensive language or personal attacks
* Inappropriate nicknames or aliases
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, spamming, or disruptive behavior
* Discriminatory jokes or language
* Private harassment
* Using inappropriate metaphors or comparisons related to slavery/servitude

## Enforcement

Our moderation process follows these steps:

1. Warning: First-time violations receive a warning
2. Temporary Removal: Continued misconduct results in temporary removal
3. Permanent Ban: Persistent violations lead to permanent exclusion
4. Appeal Process: Bans can be appealed privately with maintainers

Maintainers will:

* Respond promptly to reported violations
* Maintain higher standards of conduct
* Exercise fair judgment in enforcement
* Keep all reports confidential

These guidelines apply across all project spaces, including:

* GitHub repositories
* Discord channels
* Social media platforms
* Other official forums

Contact the maintainers immediately if you experience or witness violations of this code of conduct.
